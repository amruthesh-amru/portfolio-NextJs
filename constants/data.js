      `A self-taught developer who likes to solve interesting and challenging problems.`,
      `Hello there! I'm Amruthesh, a passionate full-stack developer with a knack for turning ideas into reality through code. My journey in programming began during my second year of engineering in computer science with Java, and it quickly expanded into the dynamic world of web development with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Over time, I have honed my skills in modern frameworks like React and libraries like Splide, as well as backend technologies including Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB.`,
      `My work is driven by self-motivation and a passion for solving problems. I excel at transforming loosely defined ideas into concrete requirements, delivering code, and ensuring projects are completed on time. Whether it’s front-end design, back-end development, or full project lifecycle management, I’m eager to take on challenges at every stage.`,
      `With a strong foundation and a clear vision, I’m dedicated to continuously learning and applying my knowledge to craft impactful solutions that make a difference. Join me as I code my way through challenges, broaden my horizons, and create meaningful web experiences in the ever-evolving world of development.`,
      `I've been programming and building applications in  Javascript, NodeJs, ExpressJs, MongoDB, Mongoose, ReactJs, NextJS, HTML, CSS, Material UI, Tailwind.`,
